The line `#define LOG(x) std::cout << x << std::endl;` is a preprocessor macro definition in C++. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### 1. `#define LOG(x)`

- **`#define`**: This is a preprocessor directive used to define macros. A macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the code that the macro represents.
  
- **`LOG(x)`**: This defines a macro named `LOG`. The `x` inside the parentheses indicates that this macro takes one argument. When `LOG(x)` is used in the code, the argument `x` will be substituted with whatever is passed to it.

### 2. `std::cout << x << std::endl;`

- **`std::cout`**: This is an object of the output stream class `std::ostream` used for printing text to the standard output, typically the console. `std` is the standard namespace that contains the `cout` object.

- **`<< x`**: This is the stream insertion operator. It is used to send the value of `x` to the `std::cout` stream, meaning it will be printed to the console.

- **`<< std::endl;`**: The `std::endl` manipulator inserts a newline character (`\n`) into the output stream and then flushes the stream, ensuring that the output is immediately displayed.

### Full Explanation:

- **Preprocessor Replacement**: When the preprocessor encounters `LOG(some_value)` in your code, it replaces `LOG(some_value)` with `std::cout << some_value << std::endl;`.

- **Purpose**: This macro is a convenient shorthand for printing debug or log messages to the console. Instead of typing `std::cout << x << std::endl;` every time you want to print something, you can just use `LOG(x)`.

### Example Usage:

```cpp
int main() {
    int number = 42;
    LOG("The number is " << number);  // This expands to: std::cout << "The number is " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Equivalent Code Without the Macro:

Without the macro, the above code would look like this:

```cpp
int main() {
    int number = 42;
    std::cout << "The number is " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Using the macro simplifies the code and makes it easier to write consistent logging messages throughout your codebase.
